├─────── Types of computer networks
│			│
│			│
│			├──Geographic Scope
│			│
│			│		1. (PAN) Personal Area Network: is a network that connects devices within a very
│			│				small area, typically within a few meters.
│			│				PANs are commonly used for connecting
│			│				personal devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops using technologies
│			│				such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. [10m ~ 15m]
│			│
│			│		2. (HAN) Home Area Network: is a network that connects devices within a home.
│			│				HANs are used to share internet connections, files, and resources among
│			│				devices such as computers, smartphones, smart TVs, and IoT devices.
│			│
│			│		3. (LAN) Local Area Network: is a network that connects
│			│				devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home,
│			│				office, or campus. LANs are typically used for sharing resources
│			│				like files, printers, and internet connections among connected devices.
│			│
│			│		4. (CAN) Campus Area Network: is a network that connects multiple LANs within
│			│				a limited geographical area, such as a university campus or corporate campus.
│			│				CANs are used to facilitate communication and resource sharing among different
│			│				departments or buildings within the campus.
│			│
│			│		5. (MAN) Metropolitan Area Network: is a network that spans a city or a large campus. 
│			│				It is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN. MANs are used to connect multiple 
│			│				LANs within a metropolitan area, providing high-speed connectivity and efficient 
│			│				resource sharing.
│			│
│			│		6. (WAN) Wide Area Network: is a network that spans a large geographical area
│			│				and connects multiple LANs. The internet is the largest example of a WAN.
│			│				WANs are used to connect remote offices, data centers, and users across the globe.
│			│
│			│		7. (GAN) Global Area Network: is a network that spans multiple countries
│			│				and connects various WANs. GANs are used by multinational corporations and
│			│				government organizations to facilitate global communication and resource sharing.
│			│
│			│
│			└──Specialized Networks
│
│					1. (SAN) Storage Area Network: is a specialized network that provides access to
│							consolidated, block-level data storage. SANs are typically used in data centers
│							to improve storage utilization and performance by allowing multiple servers to
│							access shared storage devices.
│
│					2. (EPN) Enterprise Private Network: is a network that is built and managed
│							by an organization to connect its various locations and provide secure
│							communication and resource sharing among employees. EPNs are typically used
│							by large corporations and government agencies.
│
│					3. (VPN) Virtual Private Network: is a secure network that uses encryption
│							to create a private connection over a public network, such as the internet.
│							VPNs are commonly used by remote workers to securely access their organization's
│							resources and data.

│																				      		Terminator      ^	     	  ^			
│			1. Bus Topology: In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single   		 ├──────>───┴──>───┬──>───┴─>──┬────>──Centrale
│				central cable, known as the bus. Data is transmitted in both directions				               ↓ 	   	   ↓       Cable
│				along the bus, and each device listens for data addressed to it.								   └pc3        └pc4
│				Bus topologies are simple and cost-effective but can be prone to collisions
│				and are not very scalable.
│
│			2. Star Topology: In a star topology, all devices are connected to a
│				central hub or switch. Data is transmitted from the source device to the hub,			PC1─────┐		┌─────PC2
│				which then forwards it to the destination device. Star topologies are easy					  Switch or Hub			
│				to manage and troubleshoot, but if the central hub fails, the entire network			PC4─────┘     	└─────PC3
│				goes down.
│
│			3. Ring Topology: In a ring topology, devices are connected in a circular
│				fashion, with each device connected to two other devices. Data is transmitted				┌> 	PC1   ⤵
│				in one direction around the ring. Ring topologies can provide good performance		   	PC4				PC2
│				and are relatively easy to install, but a failure in one device can disrupt					^--- PC3  ⤶
│				the entire network.
│
│			4. Mesh Topology: In a mesh topology, each device is connected to every
│				other device in the network. This provides multiple paths for data to travel,       PC1	-----------	PC2
│				ensuring high redundancy and reliability. Mesh topologies are highly scalable		 |		 X       |
│				and can handle high traffic loads, but they can be complex and expensive to			PC3	----------- PC4
│				implement.
│
│			5. Hybrid Topology: A hybrid topology combines two or more different topologies
│				to create a network that meets specific requirements. For example, a star-bus
│				hybrid topology combines the features of both star and bus topologies.
│				Hybrid topologies can provide flexibility and scalability,
│				but they can also be more complex to design and manage.

├─────── Network Devices
│
│	1. Router: A router is a networking device that connects multiple networks together
│		and directs data packets between them. It uses routing tables and protocols to
│		determine the best path for data to travel. Routers are commonly used to
│		connect home or office networks to the internet.
│
│	2. Switch: A switch is a networking device that connects devices within a local area
│		network (LAN) and facilitates communication between them. It operates at the data
│		link layer of the OSI model and uses MAC addresses to forward data packets to
│		the correct destination device. Switches help improve network performance by
│		reducing collisions and increasing bandwidth.
│
│	3. Hub: A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a
│		local area network (LAN). It operates at the physical layer of the OSI model
│		and simply broadcasts data packets to all connected devices. Hubs are less
│		efficient than switches, as they do not filter or direct traffic, leading to
│		collisions and reduced performance.
│
│	4. Modem: A modem (short for modulator-demodulator) is a device that converts
│		digital data from a computer into analog signals for transmission over telephone
│		lines or cable systems, and vice versa. Modems are commonly used to connect
│		home or office networks to the internet.
│
│	5. Access Point: An access point (AP) is a networking device that allows
│		wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi or other wireless
│		technologies. Access points are commonly used in homes, offices, and public
│		places to provide wireless internet access.
│
│	6. Firewall: A firewall is a security device that monitors and controls incoming
│		and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls
│		can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both. They help protect
│		networks from unauthorized access, cyber threats, and data breaches.
│
│	7. IDS/IPS: An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
│		are security devices that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and
│		potential threats. An IDS alerts administrators of potential intrusions, while
│		an IPS takes proactive measures to block or prevent the detected threats.
│		IDS/IPS systems help enhance network security and protect against cyber attacks.

├─────── Network Protocols
│
│	1. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): is the foundational
│		protocol suite for the internet and most modern networks. It provides a set of
│		rules and standards for data transmission, addressing, and routing. TCP/IP
│		ensures reliable and efficient communication between devices on a network.
│
│	2. HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure): is the protocol used
│		for transmitting web pages and other resources over the internet. HTTPS is
│		the secure version of HTTP, which uses encryption (SSL/TLS) to protect data
│		during transmission.
│
│	3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol): is a protocol used for transferring files
│		between computers over a network. FTP allows users to upload and download
│		files to and from a remote server.
│
│	4. SMTP/POP3/IMAP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol/Post Office Protocol 3/Internet Message Access Protocol):
│		are protocols used for sending and receiving email. SMTP is used for sending emails,
│		while POP3 and IMAP are used for retrieving emails from a mail server.
│
│	5. DNS (Domain Name System): is a protocol that translates human-readable domain
│		names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses (e.g.,)
│		that computers use to identify each other on a network. DNS is essential for
│		browsing the internet and accessing online resources.
│
│	6. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): is a protocol that automatically
│		assigns IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices on a network.
│		DHCP simplifies network management by eliminating the need for manual IP address
│		configuration.

│	7. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol): is a protocol used for monitoring
│		and managing network devices, such as routers, switches, and servers. SNMP allows
│		network administrators to collect and analyze performance data, configure devices,
│		and troubleshoot network issues.
